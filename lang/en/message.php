    'about 3'=>"Behind the BGBIN brand, there is Valerie N'gbala. <br><br><br>

    My passion for sewing was passed on to me by my mother who, when I was a child, made clothes for us. It was fascinating. But it was later, in 2010, during a visit to a village in Ivory Coast that it clicked. On this occasion, I was able to meet weavers who made loincloths. This is what gave me the idea of ​​using artisanal fabrics, which I wanted to use for our clothes. <br><br><br>

    Ivory Coast is one of the largest cotton producing countries. We also have the privilege of counting among our artisans, men and women who still work cotton manually to make fabric. These fabrics, in multiple shades, deserve to be known and highlighted because they are very pleasant to wear. All the clothes I offer are 100% “handmade”. The originality of the fabrics and the multitude of patterns I use are an inexhaustible source of inspiration. The challenge I set for myself was to create an original, elegant, modern and exclusive brand. <br><br><br>

    Why BGBIN? <br><br><br>

    Today we live in a modern, constantly evolving society in which women must fight daily to assert themselves. It was this observation that inspired me. <br><br><br>

    We want each person to feel UNIQUE with the BGBIN brand. <br><br><br>

    Our clientele is quite diverse and is extremely enthusiastic about purchasing our different clothing items. <br><br><br>

    “BGBIN” which is an Akan word, an ethnic group from Ivory Coast, means “Despite obstacles, nothing can stop me from moving forward”. <br><br><br>
